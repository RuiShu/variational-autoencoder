##Variational Auto-encoder

A basic implementation of variational autoencoders using my personal work-flow format that is highly modular and that is GPU-compatible. For comparison, check out [Joost van Amersfoort's](https://github.com/y0ast/VAE-Torch). You can run the MNIST experiment by doing:

`./run_gpu`

or

`./run_cpu`
