##Variational Auto-encoder

A basic implementation of variational autoencoders using my personal work-flow format that is highly modular and that is GPU-compatible. This repo drew its initial inspirations from [Joost van Amersfoort's repo](https://github.com/y0ast/VAE-Torch). You can run the MNIST experiment by doing:

`./run_gpu`

or

`./run_cpu`
